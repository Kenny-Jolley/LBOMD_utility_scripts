# LBOMD_utility_scripts
A collection of utility scripts for use with the Loughborough MD code

These python scripts are only useful to me and others working with the LBOMD code.


## Installation

Clone the repository to a directory of your choice, and add this directory to your path.

To make the python scripts executable, run

`chmod +x md_*`


## Usage

The scripts can be called directly and passed options on the command line, or imported into other scripts.

`md_setup_simtime.py  simtime`  
Sets the maximum simulation time to "simtime".
